/**
 * Extensions to the model that allow us to keep track of history, still an in-memory format.
 *
 * Where model.proto stores the current state, this stores snapshots of that state so we can track (and rewrite)
 * history.
 *
 * This will be used by parts of the app that display graphs, or for allowing the user to correct themselves (for
 * example if they forget to check a task as done in the previous day).
